            Six of the seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened or endangered globally. There are many ways that these animals are threatened and can be discussed under two main categories.

            Natural threats
        </h1>

        <p id="content">
            The major natural dangers to marine turtles come from predators. Wild dogs. Jackals, wild boars, mongooses, water and land monitors, as well as other
            On nesting beaches, certain ant and crab species can be thought of as natural predators of marine turtle eggs and hatchlings.
            <br><br> 
            Hatchlings in the sea are preyed upon by killer whales, orca whales, sharks, other reef fish, and seabirds. Sometimes severe weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, draughts, and the El Nino phenomena can harm turtle nests that have already been laid.Furthermore, diseases (especially <a href="https://tinyurl.com/5bzvmvw8">fibropapillomatosis</a>), fouling, and parasites also trouble the turtles.
            <br><br>
            Sea turtles will suffer unforeseeable repercussions as a result of the commencing global climate change. On the one hand, this is about how beaches and coasts have lost their significance as important nesting grounds. Additionally, the average breeding temperature affects both the male and female growth. If this number is too high, there won't be any more men born, which is obviously catastrophic for the population. Hatcheries are the only artificial, temperature-controlled semi-natural breeding habitats that can be used as a countermeasure in this situation.
            <br><br>
            However, sea turtles are well adapted to these threats through millions of years of evolution; they do not pose a threat to the continued existence of sea turtles. However, the situation is different due to the massive man-made threats in the last few centuries.

        <h1 id="Humanthreats">Human Threats</h1>
        <p>
            Today marine turtles are in great danger mostly due to the activities of human beings, Some of the man made threats are briefly described below. 
        </p>

        <h2>KILL FOR MEAT</h2>
        <p>
            Slaughter of marine turtles for meat and live turtles entangled in fishing gears is a traditional practice in Sri Lanka, reducing the turtle population.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>KILL FOR ORNAMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            Hawksbill turtles have been hunted for their beautiful shell and carapace, but synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to replace the tortoiseshell diet. This will help protect the critically endangered species.

            <img src="./images/3. Threats page/shell3.jpg" alt="shell3">
        </div>

        <h2>EGG COLLECTION</h2>
        <p>
            Marine turtles in Sri Lanka are vulnerable to illegal poaching, which is a widespread form of exploitation. Female turtles lay their eggs on beaches, making them easy prey for egg collectors who take the eggs and sell them. This is except in places where conservation programmes are implemented. The eggs are sold at markets for consumption or to turtle hatcheries.

        </div>

        <h2>FISHERY</h2>
        <p>
            Marine turtles are mainly affected by modern fishing gear, such as gill nets and shrimp trawling, which can cause serious harm to them. Over 200 turtles in Sri Lanka are entangled annually in these nets.

        </div>

        <h2>POLUTTION</h2>
        <p>
            Coral reefs are important for feeding and protecting marine turtles from sea erosion, but are being destroyed by unsustainable harvesting and pollution in Sri Lanka. These polution makes a huge threat for Turtles in various aspects, such as oil leaks from ships and plastic disposal has a major threat on these creatures.

    <section class="section4">    <!-- PREVENTION AND INTRO TO CONSERVATION HATCHERIES -->
        <h1>How we can prevent these threats?</h1>

        <p>
            In Sri Lanka, there are numerous strategies to safeguard sea turtles from risks posed by people. To save this species, the Sri Lankan government has authorized the construction of hatcheries. In 12 of the 15 resorts, breeding of healthy turtles in pools was noticed for more than 24 hours while sea turtle conservation centers in Sri Lanka were being monitored and evaluated. Through a number of initiatives, The Turtle Conservation Project (TCP) of Sri Lanka seeks to develop and support the implementation of sustainable sea turtle conservation techniques.
